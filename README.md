# Resources
## Resources, tutorials, links and other information with input from students

We will create a set of general resources for students to use and add to by pull requests. Please make suggestions for what you would like to have included as useful links, files, and resources. We can add links into a links file, files, samples, code, and data here!

We are doing it as pull requests so we have the chance to review and ensure appropriateness of the links and resources added here.

Have a favorite site you use for tutorials and help? PR and we can add it here! Have a favorite discussion board that has helped you in the class? PR! 

I can't promise we will add it all, and don't be offended please if we ever do not but I believe this has the potential to be quite useful and it can take on a life of its own, even beyond the courses. I hope we can continue to expand these resources and who knows, perhaps they will enhance the educational experience of people from around the world!
